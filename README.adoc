== 1. Two Sum

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
[source,text]

----
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
----

Example 2:
[source,text]

----
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
----

Example 3:
[source,text]

----
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
----

== 2. Add Two Numbers

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.
The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit.
Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example 1:
[source,text]

----
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807
----

Example 2:
[source,text]

----
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
----

Example 3:
[source,text]

----
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
----

== 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:
[source,text]

----
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
----

Example 2:
[source,text]

----
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
----

Example 3:
[source,text]

----
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
----

Notice that the answer must be a substring, "*pwke*" is a subsequence and not a substring.

== 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays

Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be `O(log (m+n))`.

Example 1:
[source,text]

----
Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.
----

Example 2:
[source,text]

----
Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
Output: 2.50000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
----

== 5. Longest Palindromic Substring

Given a string `s`, return the longest palindromic substring in `s`.

Example 1:
[source,text]

----
Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.
----

Example 2:
[source,text]

----
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
----

== 7. Reverse Integer

Given a signed 32-bit integer `x`, return `x` with its digits reversed.
If reversing `x` causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

Example 1:
[source,text]

----
Input: x = 123
Output: 321
----

Example 2:
[source,text]

----
Input: x = -123
Output: -321
----

Example 3:
[source,text]

----
Input: x = 120
Output: 21
----

Example 4:
[source,text]

----
Input: x = 1534236469
Output: 0
----
