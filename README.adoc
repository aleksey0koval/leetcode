== 1. Two Sum

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
[source,text]

----
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
----

Example 2:
[source,text]

----
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
----

Example 3:
[source,text]

----
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
----

== 2. Add Two Numbers

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.
The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit.
Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example 1:
[source,text]

----
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807
----

Example 2:
[source,text]

----
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
----

Example 3:
[source,text]

----
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
----

== 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:
[source,text]

----
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
----

Example 2:
[source,text]

----
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
----

Example 3:
[source,text]

----
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
----

Notice that the answer must be a substring, "*pwke*" is a subsequence and not a substring.

== 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays

Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be `O(log (m+n))`.

Example 1:
[source,text]

----
Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.
----

Example 2:
[source,text]

----
Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
Output: 2.50000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
----

== 5. Longest Palindromic Substring

Given a string `s`, return the longest palindromic substring in `s`.

Example 1:
[source,text]

----
Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.
----

Example 2:
[source,text]

----
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
----

== 7. Reverse Integer

Given a signed 32-bit integer `x`, return `x` with its digits reversed.
If reversing `x` causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

Example 1:
[source,text]

----
Input: x = 123
Output: 321
----

Example 2:
[source,text]

----
Input: x = -123
Output: -321
----

Example 3:
[source,text]

----
Input: x = 120
Output: 21
----

Example 4:
[source,text]

----
Input: x = 1534236469
Output: 0
----

== 8. String to Integer (atoi)

Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s atoi function).

The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:

. Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
. Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is `-` or `+`.
Read this character in if it is either.
This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively.
Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
. Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached.
The rest of the string is ignored.
. Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. `"123" -> 123`, `"0032" -> 32`).
If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
. If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-2e31, 2e31 - 1]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range.
Specifically, integers less than `-2e31` should be clamped to `-2e31`, and integers greater than `2e31 - 1` should be clamped to `2e31 - 1`.
. Return the integer as the final result.

Note:

* Only the space character `' '` is considered a whitespace character.
* Do not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.

Example 1:
[source,text]

----
Input: s = "42"
Output: 42
Explanation: The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1: "42" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
Step 2: "42" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
Step 3: "42" ("42" is read in)
The parsed integer is 42.
Since 42 is in the range [-2e31, 2e31 - 1], the final result is 42.
----

Example 2:
[source,text]

----
Input: s = "   -42"
Output: -42
Explanation:
Step 1: "   -42" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
Step 2: "   -42" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
Step 3: "   -42" ("42" is read in)
The parsed integer is -42.
Since -42 is in the range [-23e1, 2e31 - 1], the final result is -42.
----

Example 3:
[source,text]

----
Input: s = "4193 with words"
Output: 4193
Explanation:
Step 1: "4193 with words" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
Step 2: "4193 with words" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
Step 3: "4193 with words" ("4193" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
The parsed integer is 4193.
Since 4193 is in the range [-2e31, 2e31 - 1], the final result is 4193.
----

== 9. Palindrome Number

Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a *palindrome*, and `false` otherwise.

Example 1:
[source,text]

----
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
----

Example 2:
[source,text]

----
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
----

Example 3:
[source,text]

----
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
----

== 11. Container With Most Water

You are given an integer array height of length `n`.
There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the stem:[i^{th}] line are (`i, 0`) and (`i, height[i]`).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

Example 1:
[source,text]

----
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Output: 1

== 12. Integer to Roman

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

[source,text]
----
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
----

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`.
The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right.
However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`.
Instead, the number four is written as `IV`.
Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four.
The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`.

There are six instances where subtraction is used:

* `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make `4` and `9`.
* `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make `40` and `90`.
* `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make `400` and `900`.

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

Example 1:

[source,text]
----
Input: num = 3 Output: "III" Explanation: 3 is represented as 3 ones.
----

Example 2:

[source,text]
----
Input: num = 58 Output: "LVIII" Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.
----

Example 3:

[source,text]
----
Input: num = 1994 Output: "MCMXCIV" Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
